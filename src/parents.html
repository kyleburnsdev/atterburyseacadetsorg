      <h1>Being a Sea Cadet or League Cadet Parent</h1>
      <h2>Thank you for your interest</h2>
      <p>Thank you for your interest in the Atterbury Battalion of the United States Naval Sea Cadets.   We believe this is one of the best youth organizations available today.  As parents or potential new cadets, we are sure you are going to have many questions.  While this pamphlet is not all inclusive, it will hopefully answer a few of the common questions, as well as direct you to the resources available for other answers.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps is a nationwide organization dedicated to helping American youth aged 13 through the summer after High School graduation realize personal success and achievement. The U.S. Navy League Cadet Corps shares a common mission and serves youth aged 10 through 13.  With the help of our officers, instructors, and military units, young men and women learn basic naval customs and traditions, while also learning the value of patriotism, courage, self-reliance, teamwork, and accountability.</p>
      <p>Membership allows cadets the opportunity to sample military life with no obligation to join any branch of the armed forces.  Should cadets decide to enlist, their training may allow them entry at an advanced pay grade.</p>
      <p>Many things about this program will be new to you, especially for parents who have had no previous military experience.  It is not unusual for parents or a new Cadet to feel “lost” in the beginning.  If so, remember, I and the other officers have an open-door policy with all parents.  If at any time you have questions, concerns, or ideas, feel free to contact our unit Commanding Officer at <a href="mailto:co@atterburyseacadets.org">co@atterburyseacadets.org</a></p>
      <h2>Get Involved!</h2>
      <p>Atterbury Sea Cadet parents are an amazing resource to our program and we could not get by without their support. Every one of our parents provides critical support in enabling their child to show up to drill when they are supposed to be there and with what they are supposed to bring. This type of support is especially needed because many of our cadets have other extra-curricular activities making the well-rounded and parental support helps make that happen.</p>
      <p>In addition to the support that we need every parent providing their cadet at home, parents who would like to become more involved are encouraged to take part in our Parent Auxiliary group. From preparing meals to jumping in as a subject mater expert from time to time, a little help goes a long way.</p>
      <p>Parents who want to go "all in" may choose to become volunteers in our organization. When a parent wants to volunteer, we try to make sure they are not put in a supervisory position over their own cadet and try to keep as much space between them as possible to allow a clear separation between roles at home and roles at Sea Cadet activities. For more information about volunteering, check out our <a href="volunteering.html">Volunteers page</a>.</p>

              <p>Our son is fortunate to be a cadet of the Atterbury Battalion of the U. S. Navy Sea Cadet Corps. The opportunities that he has received during local drills and during advanced training has helped to grow him into a more self-reliant and accountable young man. We appreciate the dedication and support that is provided by the adult leaders and volunteers. We looked forward to his continued growth.</p>

              This unit rocks! Been involved with Sea Cadets for 7 years now, the last 3 have been with the Atterbury Battalion. Great group of young men and women! Our parent support is fantastic! The best thing about the unit are the adult volunteers...they put so much time, energy and effort to make the drills awesome and meaningful!

            <p>
              Our experience with the Camp Atterbury Sea Cadet program was remarkable.  The adult leadership was outstanding.  Our son was at a crossroads at fourteen years old.  He found the Sea Cadet program on his own and wanted to join.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next four years, we drove our son 5 hours round-trip each month for drill.  It was well worth it.  He become deeply invested, found clear direction for his young life.  He experienced SCUBA certification, phenomenal training on discipline as well as being allowed to participate in special warfare training in Panama, Florida and winter survival training in Colorado.  
            </p>
            <p>
              This led to his participation in the Navy ROTC program at Jacksonville, Florida.  He just finished first year of college with 3.98 GPA in mechanical engineering.  He aspires to be Navy Special Warfare officer and pursue becoming a SEAL officer.  I attribute a very real part of these accomplishments, as well as his discipline and direction to the Cadet program and training from LTjg Kyle Burns and other instructors.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Cannot recommend this program strongly enough for ALL young people.

                I can't say enough about how grateful I am for the Atterbury Sea Cadets.  My sons have had wonderful opportunities to experience a wide variety of future job prospects.  We have discussed together how just because they are part of this group, they don't necessarily have to join the military, but by gaining these experiences, they are learning what they are interested in choosing as a future career, or in other cases, what they might not absolutely want to do after high school.  As a single mother, I try to teach them everything I feel young men need to know, but I am only one person.  Sea Cadets have filled in some of the gaps in those areas where I have no expertise.  It has been a wonderful experience for all of us and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
