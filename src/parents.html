      <h1>Being a Sea Cadet or League Cadet Parent</h1>
      <h2>Thank you for your interest</h2>
      <p>Thank you for your interest in the Atterbury Battalion of the United States Naval Sea Cadets.   We believe this is one of the best youth organizations available today.  As parents or potential new cadets, we are sure you are going to have many questions.  While this pamphlet is not all inclusive, it will hopefully answer a few of the common questions, as well as direct you to the resources available for other answers.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps is a nationwide organization dedicated to helping American youth aged 13 through the summer after High School graduation realize personal success and achievement. The U.S. Navy League Cadet Corps shares a common mission and serves youth aged 10 through 13.  With the help of our officers, instructors, and military units, young men and women learn basic naval customs and traditions, while also learning the value of patriotism, courage, self-reliance, teamwork, and accountability.</p>
      <p>Membership allows cadets the opportunity to sample military life with no obligation to join any branch of the armed forces.  Should cadets decide to enlist, their training may allow them entry at an advanced pay grade.</p>
      <p>Many things about this program will be new to you, especially for parents who have had no previous military experience.  It is not unusual for parents or a new Cadet to feel “lost” in the beginning.  If so, remember, I and the other officers have an open-door policy with all parents.  If at any time you have questions, concerns, or ideas, feel free to contact our unit Commanding Officer at <a href="mailto:co@atterburyseacadets.org">co@atterburyseacadets.org</a></p>
      <h2>Get Involved!</h2>
      <p>Atterbury Sea Cadet parents are an amazing resource to our program and we could not get by without their support. Every one of our parents provides critical support in enabling their child to show up to drill when they are supposed to be there and with what they are supposed to bring. This type of support is especially needed because many of our cadets have other extra-curricular activities making the well-rounded and parental support helps make that happen.</p>
      <p>In addition to the support that we need every parent providing their cadet at home, parents who would like to become more involved, are encouraged to take part in our Parent Auxiliary group. From preparing meals to jumping in as a subject mater expert from time to time, a little help goes a long way.</p>
      <p>Parents who want to go "all in" may choose to become volunteers in our organization. When a parent wants to volunteer, we try to make sure they are not put in a supervisory position over their own cadet and try to keep as much space between them as possible to allow a clear separation between roles at home and roles at Sea Cadet activities. For more information about volunteering, check out our <a href="volunteering.html">Volunteers page</a>.</p>
