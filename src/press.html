                  <h2>Atterbury Sea Cadets Sets the Date for its Next Public Outreach and Recruiting Event for September 26, 2020</h2>
                  <p role="doc-subtitle">The event will be held at the Mill Race Park, located Columbus, Indiana</p>

                <p>September 16, 2020 - Atterbury Sea Cadets - the year-round, non-profit educational program that is dedicated to offering compelling, life-changing programs for America's youth - is proud to announce that it has set the date for its upcoming public outreach and recruiting event for September 26, 2020. Taking place at Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, it's an exceptional opportunity for people to learn more about the Corps' passionate, all-volunteer force and for interested parties to sign up to become a part of a program that will undoubtedly change their lives in more ways than one.</p>
                <p>From the moment it was originally founded until now, the core mission of the Sea Cadet program has remained the same. It aims to provide a significant value to the cadets it serves by offering not only unique training opportunities, but also by stressing the value of community service, by encouraging physical fitness, and by giving access to accelerated promotion opportunities for those cadets who go on to enlist in one of the United States' military branches. These life-changing programs for America's youth instill the values of teamwork, discipline, camaraderie and service - all through a passionate, all-volunteer force that is closely partnered with both the United States Navy and Coast Guard.</p>
                <p>The Naval Sea Cadet Corps program is intended for young people ages 13 through the completion of high school, and it has been making history since the first unit of Sea Cadets was formed in 1959. That original class was comprised of 78 young men from around the country and the NSCC has only gotten stronger from there. The Navy League Cadet Corps is modeled after the NSCC but tailored appropriately for young people ages 10 through 13.</p>
                <p>Those who may be interested in joining should know that local units of the Sea Cadet program are required to complete a minimum of 160 contact hours per year. Older students are required to attend at least one residential training program per year, which themselves range in duration from five to 14 days. Those residential training programs provide an exceptional opportunity to focus on the various vocation that exist in today's Department of Defense, while the local unit has adopted a strong emphasis on essential topics like diving and public safety.</p>
                <p>It's equally important to note that participation in the Sea Cadet program can be used as a Service-Based Learning Experience to satisfy the Employability Skills requirement of Indiana's own Graduation Pathways requirement.</p>
                <p>Those interested in visiting the upcoming September 26, 2020 event at Mill Race Park in Columbus, Indiana, or those interested in learning more about the important mission and work that the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps is completing on a daily basis, are encouraged to do so by visiting their official website at <a href="http://www.atterburyseacadets.org">http://www.atterburyseacadets.org</a>.
